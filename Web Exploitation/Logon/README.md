# The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at?
# This is under the assumption that you have seen the hint as i did

In the Factory login form, it appears that only Joe's password is being checked, and any login attempt would let us into the site. I will use the credentials:
- Username: admin
- Password: admin

After logging in, we are redirected to a flag page. Despite the notice stating that there is no flag directly on the page, we must assume that there is a flag here. Our goal is to trigger something to reveal the flag on the page itself.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Login:**
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin (or any other credentials of your choice)

2. **Flag Page:**
   - Once logged in, navigate to the flag page.

3. **DevTools Inspection:**
   - Open the browser's developer tools (usually by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" or pressing `Ctrl + Shift + I`).
   - Go to the "Application" tab.

4. **Inspect Cookies:**
   - Look for the "Cookies" section and find the cookies related to the session.
   - In your case, there might be three rows of data:
     - `Name: admin - Value: False`
     - `Name: username - Value: admin`
     - `Name: password - Value: admin`

5. **Change admin Value:**
   - Change the value of the `admin` cookie from `False` to `True`.
   - This implies that we no longer need Joe's credentials.

6. **Flag Display:**
   - Return to the flag page or refresh it.
   - You should now see the flag displayed on the page.

In your case, the flag is: `picoCTF{th3_c0nsp1r4cy_l1v3s_6edb3f5f}`.
